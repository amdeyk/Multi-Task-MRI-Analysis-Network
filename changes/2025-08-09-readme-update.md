# 2025-08-09: README overhaul

## Summary
- Replaced outdated README with production-ready documentation.
- Verified key modules (network backbone, data pipeline, CLI, distributed training, memory management) to ensure README reflects actual code.

## Motivation
The previous README was technical but outdated. Updated documentation provides clearer guidance on features like DICOM/NIfTI support, distributed training, advanced loss functions, and model serving.

## Impact
- Improved onboarding and usage clarity for contributors and users.
- Highlights production features present in the codebase, aligning documentation with implementation.

## Linked Files
- `README.md`
